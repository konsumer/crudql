# crudql

I wanted a simple way to build CRUD GraphQL APIs and frontends.

## installation

If you want to install it globally:

```bash
npm i -g @crudql/cli
``` 

If you want to use it without installing, just replace all uses of `crudql` with `npx  @crudql/cli`, in instructions below.

## usage

Check out [example](example) for a complete example, including the process I went through to make it.
